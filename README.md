### Postgres does not allow the use of relative file path reference with the COPY FROM command.  Furthermore, Postgres also doesn't allow the use of a variable to declare the file path.  As such, an exact file path must be used for each of the 6 tables (sorry...I tried)

### Connection variables are declared in the dbconfig.py file
